## Code Splitting Introduction

This repo explores code splitting with React and Webpack. It is not meant to be used as a boilerplate, but more as inspiration for learning what code splitting actually does.

## Features
- Preact instead of React for smaller bundle size
- Code splitting using [dynamic-import](https://github.com/airbnb/babel-plugin-dynamic-import-webpack)
- Prefetching async chunks using [preload-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/preload-webpack-plugin)
